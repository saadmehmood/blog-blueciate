              <p>
                When you buy our products/services, your purchase is covered by our 30-day money-back
                guarantee. If you are, for any reason, not entirely happy with your purchase, we
                will cheerfully issue a full refund. We develop and sell software that we use ourselves
                every day and have thousands of satisfied customers worldwide, and our support is
                second to none. That is why we can afford to back our products with this special
                guarantee. To request a refund, simply contact us with your purchase details within
                thirty (30) days of your purchase. Please include your order number (sent to you
                via email after ordering) and optionally tell us why you’re requesting a refund
                – we take customer feedback very seriously and use it to constantly improve our
                products and quality of service. Refunds are not being provided for services delivered
                in full such as installation service and provided knowledge base hosting service.
                Refunds are being processed within 21 days period.
